Bio
======
Hello, my name is Francesco Pio Ramunno and I am a PhD student at the University of Geneva (Switzerland), in collaboration with the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland in Brugg/Windisch. My research bridges Deep Learning and Solar Physics, with a focus on generative models, video forecasting, and diffusion-based architectures. I work on applying and benchmarking state-of-the-art models—such as DDPMs and latent diffusion—for complex spatio-temporal prediction tasks involving real-world physics data from the Sun. In this blog, I share updates on my research, including slides, code, and publications that reveal the scientific and methodological thinking behind my work. Feel free to reach out via email for any questions or collaborations!

Work Experience
======

Polymathic AI (Simons Foundation) — AI Foundation Models for Science Intern
------

📍 New York City (USA) | 🗓️ March 2025 – August 2025

At Polymathic AI, I'm working on building foundation models tailored to solar physics. I develop and train advanced diffusion-based models for image and video prediction tasks on solar data from the NASA SDO mission. My main focus is ensuring these models are not just accurate visually, but scientifically interpretable — transforming raw predictions back into the physical domain to aid real-world research on magnetic field evolution.

European Space Agency (ESA) — Data Science and Machine Learning Intern
------

📍 Frascati (Italy) | 🗓️ March 2022 – August 2022

During this internship, I developed a machine learning pipeline to study Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The work included building a structured database and implementing models to predict the physical composition of asteroids, doubling the accuracy compared to classical methods — a satisfying example of how ML can enhance planetary science.

University of Rome Tor Vergata — Data Science Intern
------

📍 Rome (Italy) | 🗓️ March 2021 – August 2021

I performed morphological analyses on X-ray data from the XMM-Newton telescope, using wavelet filtering techniques. This allowed for a >30% improvement in parameter measurement accuracy, highlighting the role of data preprocessing in astrophysical studies.
