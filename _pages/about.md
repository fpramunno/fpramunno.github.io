Bio
======
Hello, my name is Francesco Pio Ramunno and I am a PhD student at the University of Geneva (Switzerland) in collaboration with the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland in Brugg/Windisch (CH). My research focuses both on the Deep Learning side and the Solar Physics side with the aim to exploit new science using the new techniques of artificial intelligence to predict and understand the unknown features of the Sun.
In this blog you will be updated on my latest advancements in the research field and you will also find the material (slides, papers, code snippets, ...) I use to better understand the flow of thoughts behind my articles.
For any question feel free to send me an email! 

Work Experience
======

Polymathic AI (Simons Foundation) — AI Foundation Models for Science Intern
------

📍 New York City (USA) | 🗓️ March 2025 – August 2025
At Polymathic AI, I'm working on building foundation models tailored to solar physics. I develop and train advanced diffusion-based models for image and video prediction tasks on solar data from the NASA SDO mission. My main focus is ensuring these models are not just accurate visually, but scientifically interpretable — transforming raw predictions back into the physical domain to aid real-world research on magnetic field evolution.

European Space Agency (ESA) — Data Science and Machine Learning Intern
------

📍 Frascati (Italy) | 🗓️ March 2022 – August 2022
During this internship, I developed a machine learning pipeline to study Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The work included building a structured database and implementing models to predict the physical composition of asteroids, doubling the accuracy compared to classical methods — a satisfying example of how ML can enhance planetary science.

University of Rome Tor Vergata — Data Science Intern
------

📍 Rome (Italy) | 🗓️ March 2021 – August 2021
I performed morphological analyses on X-ray data from the XMM-Newton telescope, using wavelet filtering techniques. This allowed for a >30% improvement in parameter measurement accuracy, highlighting the role of data preprocessing in astrophysical studies.
